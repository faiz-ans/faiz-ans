I am motivated to realize systemic and infrastructural change, emphasizing my engineering efforts towards the design of more efficient, fair, and sustainable processes and pipelines.

Currently, I'm contributing towards collective action in the tech space in the capacity of backend engineering. 

Previously, at Filmtools, I designed and deployed the proof of concept of a scalable KVM-based cloud computation and rendering service, driven by vGPU VFIO passthrough, aimed at improving the accesibility of cloud services for artists, scientists, and studios over contemporary solutions like AWS, GCP, or Azure. Code snippets provided [here](), and stakeholder demo reel can be found [here](https://youtu.be/JZ0YT_dNXtA).
