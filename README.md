I am motivated to realize systemic and infrastructural change, emphasizing my engineering efforts towards the design of more efficient, fair, and sustainable processes and pipelines.

Currently, I'm contributing towards collective action in the tech space in the capacity of backend engineering. 

At my previous post at Filmtools, I designed and deployed the proof of concept for a scalable GPU-driven cloud computation and rendering service, aimed specifically at improving the accesibility of cloud services for artists, scientists, and studios over contemporary solutions like AWS, GCP, or Azure. Code snippets of this initative can be found in this repository, and a stakeholder demo here.
